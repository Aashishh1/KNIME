## 📘 Overview

Credit card fraud is one of the most significant concerns in the financial industry.  
This project leverages **machine learning** techniques implemented on the **KNIME Analytics Platform** to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

The main objective is to:
- Identify the **most accurate classifier**.
- Handle the **imbalance in dataset classes** effectively.
- Evaluate models based on **accuracy**, **recall**, **precision**, **AUC**, and **computational cost**.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

| Model | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| 🌲 **Random Forest (RF)** | Ensemble method reducing overfitting and variance. |
| ⚙️ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** | Works efficiently with high-dimensional data. |
| 📊 **Naive Bayes (NB)** | Based on conditional probability; simple and fast. |
| 🧩 **Logistic Regression (LR)** | Great for binary classification tasks. |
| 🔗 **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)** | Distance-based classifier for comparison. |
| 🧠 **MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP)** | Neural network model for non-linear decision boundaries. |
